  "idea": "A 'Trivia Challenge' quiz web app that serves three purposes: 1) Help people assess their knowledge about Microsoft Fabric, 2) Demonstrate Azure and Microsoft Fabric technologies, 3) Serve as a booth animation during Microsoft Ignite event. Based on Fabric Flashcards, with Kahoot/Duolingo-inspired UX. Game includes waiting screen, registration, timed quiz gameplay with dynamic difficulty, and results/leaderboard. Features comprehensive telemetry capture sent to Microsoft Fabric for analysis.",

    "name": "Microsoft Fabric Trivia Challenge",
    "mission": "Create an engaging quiz game that helps people assess their Microsoft Fabric knowledge while demonstrating Azure and Fabric technologies at Microsoft Ignite",
    "audience": "Microsoft Ignite attendees and Microsoft Fabric learners",
    "summary": "A Kahoot/Duolingo-inspired quiz web app where players have a base 1 minute to answer randomized Microsoft Fabric questions, with the ability to earn up to 1 additional minute through completed streaks (maximum 2 minutes total). Difficulty is controlled by time pressure and number of answer choices. Features forgiving streak system and comprehensive telemetry including all user interactions.",
    "constraints": [
      "Game must be playable with touch, mouse and keyboard only (ZCBM for answer choices)",
      "Base 1 minute timer with streak bonuses up to 2 minutes total",
      "Comprehensive telemetry: all clicks, mouse movements (max 10 points/sec), game events",
      "Real-time telemetry capture to Microsoft Fabric",
      "Support for 10 concurrent players initially, scalable to 80K",
      "Both daily and cumulative leaderboards"
    ],
    "challenges": [
      "Real-time telemetry performance: Use batching and asynchronous processing to avoid impacting game performance",
      "High concurrent users at Ignite: Implement proper scaling with Azure App Service and connection pooling for Cosmos DB", 
      "Touch vs mouse interaction differences: Thorough testing across devices and input methods with responsive design",
      "Network latency affecting game experience: Implement offline-capable question caching and optimistic UI updates",
      "Dynamic timer complexity: Careful testing of streak-based time bonus calculations and UI updates",
      "Telemetry data volume: Use efficient data schemas and consider sampling strategies for mouse movement data"

  "clarifications": [
    {
      "question": "For the question content, you mentioned it's \"based on Fabric Flashcards\" - do you already have a collection of Microsoft Fabric questions prepared, or do you need help creating the question bank?",
      "answer": "Yes I have them as a JSON file"
    },
    {
      "question": "For the difficulty levels, how many levels are you planning and how should the difficulty progression work during gameplay?",
      "answer": "Three levels, always start with easy, as you progress with streaks, you progress levels. There is a caveat to the streak: a wrong answer let you go back one step in the streak, not restart it."
    },
    {
      "question": "For the leaderboard and competition aspect, what should be the primary scoring mechanism?",
      "answer": "Points weighted by difficulty level + time bonuses. The time bonuses must be proportional to the points weighted (we must not have more points from finishing early with 0 good answers rather than finishing last with 100% correct answers)."
    },
    {
      "question": "For the \"orange spooky wizards\" visual theme, do you have specific design assets or visual references in mind?",
      "answer": "Actually, I want that design (referring to Kahoot/Duolingo-style interface). We switched the theme to just mimic Kahoot/Duolingo"
    },
    {
      "question": "For the Microsoft Fabric telemetry integration, do you need help setting up the Fabric workspace and what specific telemetry events would be valuable?",
      "answer": "Yes I'm good on the Fabric part. Every touch or mouse move must be logged in (we can create heatmaps of clicks, replays of mouse movements, etc)"
    },
    {
      "question": "For the React frontend setup, do you want to use any additional UI libraries beyond Tailwind CSS?",
      "answer": "Yes, include shadcn/ui for component library"
    },
    {
      "question": "What color scheme should be used for the frontend design?",
      "answer": "Custom colors based on mockup: dark background, orange timer bar (#FFA500), vibrant answer buttons (green #10b981, blue #3b82f6, purple #a855f7, orange #f97316), white text, golden streak flasks (#fbbf24)"
    },
    {
      "question": "Should keyboard mappings be A/K/S/L (as shown in mockup) or Z/C/B/M (as mentioned in constraints)?",
      "answer": "Keep keyboard mappings configurable in a config file for easy modification later"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can players resume an in-progress game session after leaving the playing screen?",
      "answer": "No, leaving the game requires returning to registration and starting a new session"
